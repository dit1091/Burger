# Burgers

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
